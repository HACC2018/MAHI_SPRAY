Database structure in hacc-mahi-spray (https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hacc-mahi-spray/database/hacc-mahi-spray/data)

I will write this up in terms of JSON so that it is universal across the Mobile App and Web App

Other objects (tables in DB terms)  can be added to cross-link Users to cropid or Orgs to pesticideEvents, etc to speed up queries. This keeps details in one place and links in another. 

Other data points may be needed by the applications, such as color that User decided to make a certain feild on his phone app. This data isn't needed to fill in the DOA forms, but might be needed to keep that App specific to the user between sessions or betwix phones (manager: "go to farm4 and spray the field marked in RED with pesticide #25. use the Phone, so I know when it has been done")
